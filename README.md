# Guess_the_number
Guess the number game
The first player thinks of a secret number in some known range while the second player attempts to guess the number. After each guess, the first player answers either “Higher”, “Lower” or “Correct!” depending on whether the secret number is higher, lower or equal to the guess. 
This project have a simple interactive program build in Python where the computer will take the role of the first player while you play as the second player.
